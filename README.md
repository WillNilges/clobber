# clobber
A service for determining if GPUs are in use

Have your users made it a habbit of starving eachother's GPU workloads of memory? Do you want that to not happen?

Well, too bad. I'm not there yet. (ðŸš§ This app is still in development ðŸš§) But, I did create a thingy that will tell your users to be polite!

Clobber will run on login via a profile.d script and detect if anybody is using one of your GPUs.
If they are, they will get a helpful message telling them not to be a dick, and to contact people
if they are causing problems.
